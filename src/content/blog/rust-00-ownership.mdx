## Ownership
1. Each value must always have one and only one variable pointing to it, that is its owner.
2. At the end of scope of the owner, the value is dropped (i.e.) memory is deallocated.
3. Ownership is `moved` by default, but can be copied using `Copy`.

### Moving and Copying
1. Primitive values like int, bool are copied by default.

## Borrowing
1. Borrowing allows temporary references (&T or &mut T) without transferring ownership.
2. At any given time there can only be either a mutable or an unmutable reference.
3. A reference must always be valid.

### !(Mut + UnMut)
1. Cannot have mutable and unmutable ref for the same value at the same time.
2. Cannot have multiple mutable ref, to avoid race mutations to same value, if both ref are used to modify the same value. Avoids corrupting data.
3. Can have multiple unmutable ref.

### Invalid reference
Following fails because "a" is out of scope at the end of dangling fn and will be cleared. So a reference to a non existing value is not possible. (i.e.) cannot borrow from dropped value.
``` rust
fn main() {
    let aref = dangling();
}

fn dangling() -> &String {
    let a = String:from("Hello");

    &a;
}
```


## Slice

``` rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("Hello world");
    let fw = first_word(&s);
    println!("{}", fw);
}

fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    for (i, &item) in s.as_bytes().iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[..i];
        }
    }

    return &s[..];
}
```

#### Why &s[..] instead of s[..]?

- s[..] means “slice from 0 to end”
- s[..] derefs s: &String to String, then calls - `Deref<Target=str>`
- So s[..] gives a str (unsized)
- Wrapping with &: &s[..] is a &str (sized, usable)

- String owns heap memory
- &String borrows the whole struct
- &str borrows just the actual text (slice of bytes)
- You need &s[..] to convert a &String to a &str

| Expression | Type      | Notes                         |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| `s`        | `&String` | Reference to the whole String |
| `*s`       | `String`  | Dereferenced String           |
| `(*s)[..]` | `str`     | Underlying string slice       |
| `&s[..]`   | `&str`    | Reference to string slice ✅   |


## Modules

### Scenario 1: Seprate modul.rs file

- DO NOT wrap it in `mod modul { ... }`
- Instead, declare it in main.rs using mod modul;
- Then use it with use modul::... or modul::...

#### Layout
With this example layout
```text
src/
├── main.rs
└── modul.rs
```


``` rust main.rs
mod modul; // loads src/modul.rs

use modul::Breakfast;

fn main() {
    let summer_bf = Breakfast::summer_menu();
    println!("{:?}", summer_bf);
}

```

``` rust modul.rs
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Breakfast {
    pub food: String,
    pub drink: String,
}

impl Breakfast {
    pub fn summer_menu() -> Breakfast {
        Breakfast {
            food: "Toast".into(),
            drink: "Orange juice".into(),
        }
    }
}
```

mod modul; tells the compiler to load the external file, and the file must not declare mod modul {} again — that would be redundant and cause a nested path like modul::modul::Breakfast.

### Scenario 2: You define the module inline inside main.rs

- DO use `mod modul { ... }` directly
- No need for mod modul; or separate file
- You can still use modul::... if you like


``` rust main.rs
mod modul {
    #[derive(Debug)]
    pub struct Breakfast {
        pub food: String,
        pub drink: String,
    }

    impl Breakfast {
        pub fn summer_menu() -> Breakfast {
            Breakfast {
                food: "Toast".into(),
                drink: "Orange juice".into(),
            }
        }
    }
}

use modul::Breakfast;

fn main() {
    let summer_bf = Breakfast::summer_menu();
    println!("{:?}", summer_bf);
}
```


## Seprate folder sub modules
src/
├──outermodul/
|   └── innermodul.rs
├── outermodul.rs --> use innermodul;
└── main.rs --> use outermodul;

If there is an inner modul, that needs to present in a folder with same name as the outermodul. This can then be access by outermodul.


## If adding a bunch of utils to same folder
rust expects mod.rs file in directory. 
``` text
src/
└── utils/
    ├── mod.rs
    ├── math.rs
    ├── stringconcat.rs
    └── extracttoken.rs
```

Other files that we want to import into other files must be brought into scope in the mod.rs file.
``` rust
pub mod math;
pub mod stringconcat;
pub mod extracttoken;
```

In main.rs
``` rust
mod utils;  // loads utils/mod.rs and submodules

fn main() {
    // To access math and concat functions:
    let sum = utils::math::add(1, 2);
    let combined = utils::stringconcat::concat_str("foo", "bar");
}

```


| Scenario               | How to declare submodules in `mod.rs`       | How to declare in `main.rs`          | How to use modules               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Folder with `mod.rs`   | `pub mod math; pub mod concat;` in `mod.rs` | `mod utils;` in `main.rs`            | `utils::math::func()`            |
| Flat files no `mod.rs` and no foder | N/A                                         | `mod math; mod concat;` in `main.rs` | `math::func()`, `concat::func()` |


## Copy and move
In the following example, both 
1. `println!("{}", &v[0]);` 
2. `println!("{}", v[0]);` <br/>
will work.

``` rust
pub fn collections() {
    let mut v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    let v2 = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];

    v.push(1);

    println!("{}", &v[0]);
}

```

When using `v[0]` or `&v[0]`
1. i32 by default "copies" to another variable when it is assigned.
2. String and structs when assign to another var need to be passed as ref, else they will be "moved" on default. Can be cloned with .clone(). Compile err when trying to access the same after move, if not passed as ref initially.
3. `println` accepts ref of variable. `println!("{}", x);` will auto-borrow x if it implements Display by reference. E.g. String, Vec, custom structs, if v[0] is used. If not, it will accept a clone (internally), If String is passed, will auto deref to &String which implements Display interface.

4. `println!("{}", v[0]);` will work even if vector had a string at index 0, because by default [] indexing fn returns the reference not the owner and the auto deref will automatically use the &String from String.

5. But `let s = vStr[0];` will not compile if idx 0 is string
    1. We get a reference like before, but String type cant copy by default
    2. But moving from a vector isnt allowerd.
6. This is why `let a = vStr[0];` doesnt work but both `println!("{}", &v[0])` and `println!("{}", v[0])` work.

**From ChatGPT:**
| Code                           | Borrowed? | Moved? | Why it works                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `println!("{}", v[0])`         | ✅ yes     | ❌ no   | `v[0]` returns reference; auto-borrowed  |
| `println!("{}", &v[0])`        | ✅ yes     | ❌ no   | Explicitly borrowed                      |
| `println!("{}", v[0].clone())` | ❌ no      | ✅ yes  | Clones and moves the cloned value        |
| `let x = v[0];`                | ❌ no      | ❌ no   | ❌ Fails for non-Copy types like `String` |


## Generics With more Ownership understandings

### Functions accessible based on their traits
Below is an example of a generic scenario where based on the type/ trait of the incoming type,
the object gets access to different methods.
``` rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point<T,U>  {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

impl<T: Copy, U> Point<T,U> { // get_x is accessible only for variables with copy trait
    fn get_x(&self) -> T {
        self.x
    }
}

impl<T> Point<T,f64> {
    fn get_floaty(&self) -> f64 {
        self.y
    }
}

fn enumgenr() {
    let flotPt = Point { x: 5, y: 3.5 };
    flotPt.get_floaty();
    flotPt.get_x();
    let intPt = Point { x: 5, y: 3 };
    // intPt.get_floaty(); // wont work
    intPt.get_x();
}

```

### Complex Generic usecase
We try to combine two different generics and create an output combining their types.

**Calling function to give context**
1. All points contains x and y
2. There are two examples here one with a method for copy trait and another with clone trait.
3. Both examples have two points each, and combine x from pt1 and y from pt2.

``` rust
fn mixup() {
    // Copy trait
    let a = Point {x: 1, y: 3.0};
    let b = Point {x: "Hello", y: 'c'};

    let c = a.mix(b);
    println!("{:?}", c);
    println!("{:?}", a);

    // Clone trait
    let d = Point {x: String::from("tasd"), y: 3.0};
    let e = Point {x: String::from("Hello"), y: 'c'};

    let f = a.mix(b);
    println!("{:?}", f);
    println!("{:?}", d);
}
```

**Copy Trait**
1. Supports T with copy trait, e.g. int, char, static str (stored on stack, fixed size).
2. &self is a ref. Always copies. If "self" instead of "&self" was used, it means that struct "a" is moved
into the method. 
3. Which means a is no longer usable after this fn call. This is not because of the copy itself but simply how ownership is transferred if reference isn't passed.

``` rust
impl <T: Copy, U> Point<T, U> {
    fn mix<V, W>(&self, pt: Point<V, W>) -> Point<T, W> {
        Point {x: self.x, y: pt.y }
    }
}
```

**Clone Trait**
1. Support T with clone trait. e.g. String, heap allocated, can grow.
2. Here the value needs to be explicitly cloned since its not allowed to be moved out of a reference.
3. Since &self is a shared self reference.

``` rust
impl <T: Clone, U> Point<T, U> {
    fn mix<V, W>(&self, pt: Point<V, W>) -> Point<T, W> {
        Point {x: self.x.clone(), y: pt.y }
    }
}
```

**Clone trait without `&self`**

1. Support T with Clone trait, e.g. String (heap-allocated, not Copy).
2. This uses `self` instead of `&self`, meaning the method takes ownership of the whole struct.
3. Because `self` is owned (not a reference), we are allowed to move `x` out of it directly.
4. No need to clone here, even though T isn't Copy, because the method owns the value and value is moved.
5. Any method trying to access the struct after passing to method will cause a compiler error

``` rust
impl <T: Clone, U> Point<T, U> {
    fn mix<V, W>(self, pt: Point<V, W>) -> Point<T, W> {
        Point {x: self.x, y: pt.y }
    }
}
```


> &x.y always means "take a reference to x.y", regardless of whether x is already a reference or not.

## Lifetimes
Manual generic lifetime annotation is necessary only if rust compiler coudln't categorise our scenario
into one of the below rules.

1. The first rule is that the compiler assigns a different lifetime parameter to each 
lifetime in each input type. `fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32)` 
(Note the signature has no return type, if there was we would have an ambiguity requiring manual annotation)

2. The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, 
that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32`

3. The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them 
is &self or &mut self because this is a method, the lifetime of self is assigned to all 
output lifetime parameters.

``` rust
pub fn main() {
    let x = String::from("aaaa");
    let y = String::from("aa");
    longest(&x, &y);
}

fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```
1. Both inputs (longest fn) are references

2. Rust doesnt like dangling references/ ref with no value attached to them, because the value might 
have been destroyed or out of scope.

3. So in example, The function will always return either x or y — so a valid reference is being returned. 
The compiler doesn't know whether the returned reference will have the lifetime of x or y, and that’s 
why explicit lifetime annotation is required.

4. So we tell it to use a generic lifetime ('a)

5. Generic liftime annotations define the relationship between the lifetimes of multiple references 
and how they relate to each other.

6. So it doesnt change the lifetime, just lets all the references in scope understand 
how they relate to each other.

7. By adding the same lifetime `'a` to all ref and return type, we are creating a relationship 
`fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str`.

8. The relationship is that, all ref and return will have same lifetime.

9. It doesn't change the lifetime, but just assumes that the lifetime is 
the smallest lifetime out of all the arguments.

**Following will err**
``` rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");
    let result;
    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        result = longest(&string1, &string2);
    }
    println!("The longest string is '{result}'");
}
```
1. Lifetime of input refs and return is same as the lifetime of
ref with shortest lifetime.
2. string2 has shortest lifetime.
3. When trying to access result after string2's lifetime expired compiler throws 
an err. `string2 does not live long enough`

> Same rules apply to Structs holding references
```
struct Book<'a> {
    author: &'a str,
    title: &'a str,
}

pub fn main() {
    let book = Book {
        author: "George Orwell",
        title: "1984",
    };

    println!("{} by {}", book.title, book.author);
}
```

> All string literals have `'static` lifetimes, since they are stored in prpgrams binary as static strings.

## Smart Pointers
- Smart pointers are not simply references to values in memory, but could be datastructures with additional overhead
- In many cases smart pointers own the data they reference. E.g Strings and Vectors
- They are structs that implement Deref and Drop traits
    - Deref Trait: Code that specifies what happens when pointer is deref. Lets the struct be used like pointer. 
        Example: Box<T>, Rc<T>, and String all implement Deref to behave like pointers/references to their inner data (T or str)
    - Drop Trait: Like destructor. Specify what happens when smart pointer goes out of scope.

### Box<T>
- When sz of type isnt known at compile time. E.g. tree, linkedlist are recursive data structures and their actual size cant be known at compile time.
- When we need to transfer ownership of large amounts of data without copying.
- When we want to hold a value as long as it has a specific trait, and not care about the type. E.g. Box<dyn Error>, holds value of type that implements Error trait, but its type could be anything.

### RefCell
- RefCell<T> enables interior mutability: modifying data even when the outer variable is immutable.
- Borrowing rules (exclusive mutable or multiple immutable borrows) are checked at runtime instead of compile time.

### Weak pointers
Here is some additional code incase you're like me and didnt understand.

1. Rc - shared ref
2. Refcell - runtime mutability
3. Node struct(below) can have parent and vec of child
4. ::new method that creates default values for parent and child on Node creation

***In main***
1. Create two nodes, parent and child
2. Push child into Parent's vector using runtime refcell deref
3. Weak from child to parent using same refcell deref.

***Implications***
1. Child cant keep parent alive, (i.e) if parent is out of scope, child is also gone. Weak ref will not stop this from happening or linger on heap as orphan. Created using Rc::downgrade
2. Parent is a strong ref, hence owns the children.

```
struct Node {
    name: String,
    parent: RefCell<Weak<Node>>,
    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>
}

impl Node {
    fn new(name: &str) -> Node {
        Node {
            name: name.to_string(),
            parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
            children: RefCell::new(vec![])
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let parent = Rc::new(Node::new("new"));
    let child = Rc::new(Node::new("child"));

    parent.children.borrow_mut().push(Rc::clone(&child));
    println!("After adding child");
    println!("Parent Weak: {} Strong: {}", Rc::weak_count(&parent),  Rc::strong_count(&parent));
    println!("Child Weak: {} Strong: {}", Rc::weak_count(&child),  Rc::strong_count(&child));

    *child.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&parent);
    println!("After adding weak ref");
    println!("Parent Weak: {} Strong: {}", Rc::weak_count(&parent),  Rc::strong_count(&parent));
    println!("Child Weak: {} Strong: {}", Rc::weak_count(&child),  Rc::strong_count(&child));

}
```

## Concurrency

***Concurrent***
Different parts of a program make progress independently, but not necessarily at the same time.
Tasks can overlap in time (e.g., interleaved execution on a single CPU core).

Example:
1. A web server handling multiple requests "simultaneously" by switching between them rapidly (even on a single core).
2. Async programming in Rust (tokio, async/await) where tasks yield control while waiting for I/O.

***Parallel***
Different parts of a program execute simultaneously (at the exact same time). Requires multiple CPU cores/threads.

Example:
1. Running matrix multiplication on 4 CPU cores.

### Threads
1. Os run app in a process.
2. That process can spawn multiple threads.
3. Each thread can run simultaneously doing different work.
4. Execution and picking task is non deterministic.
5. Can lead to
    - Race conditions - two or more threads accessing/ modifying data in an unpredictable way.
    - Dead locks - two or more threads are depending on other thread to complete, causing both to wait indefinitely.
