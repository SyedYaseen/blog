## Docker network inspect
When debugging Docker containers, I needed to verify whether each container was connected to the correct network(s). 
This was important because network misconfiguration can cause containers to fail to communicate with each other, 
especially in multi-container setups (e.g., when using docker-compose or custom user-defined bridge networks).

To do this efficiently across all networks, I used the following command:

```
for net in $(docker network ls --format '{{.ID}}'); do
    echo "Network: $net"
    docker network inspect "$net" | jq -r '.[0].Containers[]?.Name'
    echo ""
done
```

- Lists all Docker network IDs.
- For each network, runs docker network inspect to see which containers are connected.
- Uses jq -r to extract and print only the container names in raw text format (no quotes).
- Groups the output by network, making it easy to scan for container membership.

This helped me quickly identify whether a specific container was attached to the expected network, and whether
there were any unexpected connections or missing links.
