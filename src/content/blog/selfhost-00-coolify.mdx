sudo usermod -aG sudo myadmin
```
## Secure the VPS/ Laptop

### Disable pwd auth
Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config

`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

Set the following flags on the file

- PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
- PasswordAuthentication no
- PermitEmptyPasswords no

### Firewall Hardening
optional since it caused some issues when I first set it up
```
sudo ufw reset
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

#### Allow only SSH, HTTP, HTTPS
```
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 80,443/tcp
```

#### Optional: limit SSH brute force
`sudo ufw limit OpenSSH`

#### Save changes
```
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
```

#### Sample firewall after changes
This is how it would look like Firewall is active and enabled on system startup Status: active Logging: on (low) Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), deny (routed) New profiles: skip
