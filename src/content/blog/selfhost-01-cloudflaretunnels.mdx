## Why cloudflare tunnel?
I used cloudflare tunnel to setup a staging env for my apps using my old laptop. CF tunnels has the following benefits
- No need to expose ports other than 80 and 443. So its secure.
- No port forwardign in modem to expose ports to internet. So home network is safe.
- Can setup SSL certs for free using cloudflare

## Setup in dashboard
- Attach domain to Cloudflare by setting nameserver (NS) to cloudflare nameservers
- Create a tunnel
    - CloudFlare home -> Zero Trust -> Networks -> Tunnels
    - Create Tunnel -> Copy `token` (used in next step)
    - Tunnel -> Public Host Name ->  Add public hostname
    - *.domainname.com -> service: HTTPS://localhost:443 (Wildcard sub domain)
    - Additional application settings -> TLS -> origin server name -> *.domainname.com
    - This will automatically add an entry in DNS table, 
    - If not add it manually, NAME = *; CNAME = tunnelId.cfargotunnel.com
    - Repeat steps for base domain and other domains
    - Multiple domains can be added in same tunnel

- Coolify cloudflared service
    - Create cloudflared service - set `token` as env
    - Server -> Wildcard Domain -> https://domainname.com (needs to be https)
    - Settings -> Instance Settings -> Instance's Domain -> coolify.domainname.com
    - Other services -> domain -> https://anysubdomain.domainname.com
    - Services might need their port exposed for local (same network) service access. Not necessary for tunnel access
