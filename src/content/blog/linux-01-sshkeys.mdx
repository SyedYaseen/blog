## Steps
1. Create folder `mkdir /home/user/.ssh/folder` if not already exists
2. `ssh-keygen` -> Enter folder and file name of key
3. Change ownership of folder `sudo chown -R user:user /home/user/.ssh/folder/keyname`
4. Add key to ssh `ssh-add /home/user/.ssh/folder/keyname`
5. Update config `nano ~/.ssh/config`

```
Host github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile /path/to/your/custom_key
```
6. Copy key.pub to https://github.com/settings/keys

Tip:
Above steps applicable for any service or server and if that server needs to get the pub key for SSH access into it,
`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/keyname.pub user@ipaddr`
