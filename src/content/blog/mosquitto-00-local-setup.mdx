## Docker compose setup:

Docker-Compose.yaml
```
services:
  mosquitto:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto
    hostname: mosquitto
    container_name: mosquitto
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "1883:1883"
      - "9001:9001"
    volumes:
      # - ./:/etc/mosquitto
      - ./mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
      - ./certs:/mosquitto/config/certs # If using certs
      - ./passwd:/mosquitto/config/passwd
      - ./data:/mosquitto/data
```

### Config
```
cd ../desiredFolder
nano mosquitto.conf
```

#### Paste following configs:
log_dest stdout

listener 1883
listener 8883
protocol mqtt

allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwd
persistence false


#### Password
`nano passwd`
Add `user:pwd` to file

#### Use password
1. Change permissions of pwd file for docker container
`docker exec mosquitto chown root:root /etc/mosquitto/pwd`
2. Encrypt password
`docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -U /etc/mosquitto/pwd`

### PubSub

```
sudo apt install mosquitto-clients
mosquitto_sub -v -t 'hello/topic' -u user -P pwd

# sub with local ca.crt
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 8883 \
  --cafile ./mosq/certs/ca.crt \
  -t 'hello/topic' \
  -u hymn -P localpassword \
  --insecure


mosquitto_pub -t 'hello/topic' -m 'hello MQTT' -u user -P pwd
```

## Self signed SSL certs
```
cd mosquitto/certs

# Generate CA
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -subj "/CN=LocalMQTTCA"

# Generate server key and CSR
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl req -new -out server.csr -key server.key -subj "/CN=localhost"

# Sign server cert with our CA
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365
```

- Add following to .conf
cafile /mosquitto/config/certs/ca.crt
certfile /mosquitto/config/certs/server.crt
keyfile /mosquitto/config/certs/server.key

require_certificate false


### Why require_certificate is set to false
1. This setting controls whether the client must present a certificate.
  - require_certificate false: The broker (Mosquitto) will use server-side TLS only, i.e. encrypted connection, but will not require the client to send a certificate.
  - require_certificate true: The broker will do mutual TLS, i.e. require each client to present a valid certificate signed by the CA (used for very secure internal networks).
2. Since most MQTT clients (like mqtt.js, IoT devices, etc.) donâ€™t use client certs, we usually leave this as:
  require_certificate false
3. This still ensures encrypted connections, just without enforcing client certs.

### Why is rejectUnauthorized: false in the client?
1. This tells the Node.js client not to reject self-signed or untrusted certificates.
2. In your case, since you're using a self-signed CA, the certificate is not trusted by default (unlike Let's Encrypt certs). Node.js will reject such connections unless you:
  - Provide the CA file with ca: fs.readFileSync(...)
  - OR disable cert validation with rejectUnauthorized: false
3. If you were using a cert signed by a public CA (e.g. Let's Encrypt), you'd omit rejectUnauthorized entirely.
4. Best practice: Use ca and set rejectUnauthorized: true when deploying to production with real certs.

### Debugging

1. `docker exec mosquitto netstat -tuln` check if correct ports and protocol is present
2. Temporarily set allow_anonymous true in mosquitto.conf
