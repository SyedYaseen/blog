### Problem statement

1. The goal is to reach 1 when given a positive int n and output all numbers along the way.
2. The algo to reach 1 is
   - if n is even divide by 2
   - if n is odd multiply by 2 and add 1

E.g. n = 3, output = 3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> --> 4 --> 2 --> 1

### Intuition

This is quite a simple problem, we could easily use regular multiplication and division to solve this, we can also use `bitwise operators`.
For those who aren't familiar with bitwise operators, there are the following operators we will for this problem.

1. Left shift `<< n` multiplies a number by 2, `n` times
2. Right shift `>> n` dividies number by 2, `n` times
3. Bitwise and `x & y`. If the bit values of both x and y are 1, then the output is 1 else 0.

```cpp
int x = 0b10;
int y = 0b1;
int z = x & y; // z = 0;
```

### Answer

```cpp
int main()
{
    setIO();

    unsigned long long int n, a;
    cin >> n;

    cout << n << " ";

    while (n != 0b1) // Run until n is not 1
    {
        if (n == 0)
            break;
        if (n & 0b1) // Check if last bit is a 1. => Odd number
        {
            a = n; // Keep a copy of n
            n <<= 1; // Multiply by 2
            n += a + 1; // Add it n (a) one more to multiply by 3 and add 1
        }
        else
        {
            n >>= 1; // Divide by 2 once if n is even
        }
        cout << n << " ";
    }
}

```

## <a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1083" target="_blank">Missing Number</a>

### Problem statement

1. Input 1: Given a number n
2. Input 2: All numbers from 1 to n except one number
3. We need to find that number

### Intuition

**Approach 1:**

1. Get all numbers and sort them
2. Iterate through sorted numbers. If any `number + 1` isn't equal to the next number, `number + 1` is the answer

**Approach 2:**

1. This is a mathematical approach.
2. Sum of n numbers is: n \* (n + 1) / 2.
3. When we get inputs from file one by one we subtract it from the sum.
4. The sum we are left at the end is the answer.

### Answer

**Approach 1:**
Sort and Iterate

```cpp
int main()
{
    unsigned int n, a;
    vector<unsigned int> v;
    cin >> n;

    while (cin >> a)
        v.push_back(a);
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    if (v[0] != 1)
        cout << 1;
    else
    {

        for (unsigned int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++)
        {
            if (v[i] + 1 != v[i + 1])
            {
                cout << v[i] + 1;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

```

**Approach 2:**
Sum n numbers and subtract inputs

```cpp
int main()
{
    unsigned long long n, a;
    cin >> n;
    unsigned long long sum;
    sum = n * (n + 1);
    sum >>= 1;

    while (cin >> a)
    {
        sum -= a;
    }

    cout << sum;
}
```
