# Watershed Algorithm

This is a really cool image segementation algo. Personally, I might have called this something cool like `DamBuilder` or `CraterMaker`.

It considers the image as a topography map, like the map which shows us the elevation, mountains and such, then it gets us to imagine that its raining and water fills up in the entire map (`Ark Algorithm`, Get it? because of Noah's ark). We have reached the boudary of the valley when the water is filled and we touch the nearby valley's boundary.

## What is this algo for?

This helps segment images between foreground and background and it especially useful when there are multiple objects in the image.

## How does it work?

1. Pre-process the image through Binarization, Inverse Binarization.
1. Create `markers`. Markers are regions in the image which are like core or a center of an image a.k.a lowest point of the valley. E.g. the centre of a coin.
1. Then we start filling the image from the markers.
1. Once we come in contact with the adjacent boundary, filling is complete and we've found the boundary of our image.

<Steps>

### Pre-process

- Apply Otsu Binarization.
- Invert the result, we want the centre of our coins in white.

```cpp
Mat otsuOut;
threshold(src, otsuOut, 0.0, 255.0, THRESH_OTSU);
threshold(otsuOut, otsuOut, 0.0, 255.0, THRESH_BINARY_INV);
```

### Pre-process - 2

```cpp
Mat otsuOut;
threshold(src, otsuOut, 0.0, 255.0, THRESH_OTSU);
threshold(otsuOut, otsuOut, 0.0, 255.0, THRESH_BINARY_INV);
```

### Pre-process - 3

```cpp
Mat otsuOut;
threshold(src, otsuOut, 0.0, 255.0, THRESH_OTSU);
threshold(otsuOut, otsuOut, 0.0, 255.0, THRESH_BINARY_INV);
```

</Steps>
